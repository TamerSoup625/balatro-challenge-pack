# TS' Balatro Challenge Pack
This is a mod made for [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) that adds 10 new challenges:
- **The TEST**: A "challenge" hidden within the game's source code
- **Black Paint**: Spade does not count as a suit (e.g. you can't make a Flush of Spades), start with all Spade cards
- **Nine Lives**: Start with eight Mr. Bones and survive the tougher Blinds
- **Card Collector**: Start with a Stone Card and build your deck in the Shop
- **Jokers Only**: Consumeables do not appear in the shop
- **Sidetracked**: Play a Flush Five before the final Boss
- **Icarus**: You can play the same poker hand only a few times
- **Jokers Only PLUS**: Consumeables do not appear AT ALL (and neither do Vouchers)
- **The Trial**: Most Jokers and Consumeables are banned
- **Impossible**: Tihs might actually be impossible
